# Write Spec

Write a feature specification or product requirements document (PRD) from whatever starting point the user has.

## Workflow

### 1. Understand the Feature

Accept any starting point:
- A feature name ("SSO support")
- A problem statement ("Enterprise customers keep asking for centralized auth")
- A user request ("Users want to export their data as CSV")
- A vague idea ("We should do something about onboarding drop-off")

### 2. Gather Context

Ask the user for the following. Be conversational — do not dump all questions at once. Ask the most important ones first and fill in gaps as you go:

- **User problem**: What problem does this solve? Who experiences it?
- **Target users**: Which user segment(s) does this serve?
- **Success metrics**: How will we know this worked?
- **Constraints**: Technical constraints, timeline, regulatory requirements, dependencies
- **Prior art**: Has this been attempted before? Are there existing solutions?

If the user has related material available — existing tickets, prior specs, research notes, design mockups — ask for it or read it. Otherwise work entirely from what the user provides; do not block on missing sources.

### 3. Generate the PRD

Produce a structured PRD with these sections. See **PRD Structure** below for detailed guidance on what each section should contain.

- **Problem Statement**: The user problem, who is affected, and impact of not solving it (2-3 sentences)
- **Goals**: 3-5 specific, measurable outcomes tied to user or business metrics
- **Non-Goals**: 3-5 things explicitly out of scope, with brief rationale for each
- **User Stories**: Standard format ("As a [user type], I want [capability] so that [benefit]"), grouped by persona
- **Requirements**: Categorized as Must-Have (P0), Nice-to-Have (P1), and Future Considerations (P2), each with acceptance criteria
- **Success Metrics**: Leading indicators (change quickly) and lagging indicators (change over time), with specific targets
- **Open Questions**: Unresolved questions tagged with who needs to answer (engineering, design, legal, data)
- **Timeline Considerations**: Hard deadlines, dependencies, and phasing

### 4. Review and Iterate

After generating the PRD:
- Ask the user if any sections need adjustment
- Offer to expand on specific sections
- Offer to create follow-up artifacts (design brief, engineering ticket breakdown, stakeholder pitch)

## PRD Structure

### Problem Statement
- Describe the user problem in 2-3 sentences
- Who experiences this problem and how often
- What is the cost of not solving it (user pain, business impact, competitive risk)
- Ground this in evidence: user research, support data, metrics, or customer feedback

### Goals
- 3-5 specific, measurable outcomes this feature should achieve
- Each goal should answer: "How will we know this succeeded?"
- Distinguish between user goals (what users get) and business goals (what the company gets)
- Goals should be outcomes, not outputs ("reduce time to first value by 50%" not "build onboarding wizard")

### Non-Goals
- 3-5 things this feature explicitly will NOT do
- Adjacent capabilities that are out of scope for this version
- For each non-goal, briefly explain why it is out of scope (not enough impact, too complex, separate initiative, premature)
- Non-goals prevent scope creep during implementation and set expectations with stakeholders

### User Stories

Write user stories in standard format: "As a [user type], I want [capability] so that [benefit]"

Guidelines:
- The user type should be specific enough to be meaningful ("enterprise admin" not just "user")
- The capability should describe what they want to accomplish, not how
- The benefit should explain the "why" — what value does this deliver
- Include edge cases: error states, empty states, boundary conditions
- Include different user types if the feature serves multiple personas
- Order by priority — most important stories first

Example:
- "As a team admin, I want to configure SSO for my organization so that my team members can log in with their corporate credentials"
- "As a team member, I want to be automatically redirected to my company's SSO login so that I do not need to remember a separate password"

Good user stories are INVEST: **Independent** (deliverable on their own), **Negotiable** (details can be discussed), **Valuable** (to the user, not just the team), **Estimable**, **Small** (fits one sprint), and **Testable**.

Common mistakes:
- Too vague: "As a user, I want the product to be faster" — what specifically should be faster?
- Solution-prescriptive: "As a user, I want a dropdown menu" — describe the need, not the UI widget
- No benefit: "As a user, I want to click a button" — why? What does it accomplish?
- Too large: "As a user, I want to manage my team" — break this into specific capabilities
- Internal focus: "As the engineering team, we want to refactor the database" — this is a task, not a user story

### Requirements

**Must-Have (P0)**: The feature cannot ship without these. These represent the minimum viable version of the feature. Ask: "If we cut this, does the feature still solve the core problem?" If no, it is P0.

**Nice-to-Have (P1)**: Significantly improves the experience but the core use case works without them. These often become fast follow-ups after launch.

**Future Considerations (P2)**: Explicitly out of scope for v1 but we want to design in a way that supports them later. Documenting these prevents accidental architectural decisions that make them hard later.

For each requirement:
- Write a clear, unambiguous description of the expected behavior
- Include acceptance criteria (see below)
- Note any technical considerations or constraints
- Flag dependencies on other teams or systems

Tips for categorization:
- Be ruthless about P0s. The tighter the must-have list, the faster you ship and learn.
- If everything is P0, nothing is P0. Challenge every must-have: "Would we really not ship without this?"
- P1s should be things you are confident you will build soon, not a wish list.
- P2s are architectural insurance — they guide design decisions even though you are not building them now.

### Success Metrics

**Leading indicators** — change quickly after launch (days to weeks):
- Adoption rate (% of eligible users who try the feature)
- Activation rate (% who complete the core action)
- Task completion rate, time to complete, error rate, usage frequency

**Lagging indicators** — take time to develop (weeks to months):
- Retention impact, revenue impact, NPS/satisfaction change
- Support ticket reduction, competitive win rate

**Setting targets:**
- Targets should be specific: "50% adoption within 30 days" not "high adoption"
- Base targets on comparable features, industry benchmarks, or explicit hypotheses
- Set a "success" threshold and a "stretch" target
- Define the measurement method: what tool, what query, what time window
- Specify when you will evaluate: 1 week, 1 month, 1 quarter post-launch

### Acceptance Criteria

Write acceptance criteria in Given/When/Then format or as a checklist:

**Given/When/Then**:
- Given [precondition or context]
- When [action the user takes]
- Then [expected outcome]

**Checklist format**:
- [ ] Admin can enter SSO provider URL in organization settings
- [ ] Team members see "Log in with SSO" button on login page
- [ ] Failed SSO attempts show a clear error message

Tips:
- Cover the happy path, error cases, and edge cases
- Be specific about the expected behavior, not the implementation
- Include what should NOT happen (negative test cases)
- Each criterion should be independently testable
- Avoid ambiguous words: "fast", "user-friendly", "intuitive" — define what these mean concretely

### Open Questions
- Questions that need answers before or during implementation
- Tag each with who should answer (engineering, design, legal, data, stakeholder)
- Distinguish between blocking questions (must answer before starting) and non-blocking (can resolve during implementation)

### Timeline Considerations
- Hard deadlines (contractual commitments, events, compliance dates)
- Dependencies on other teams' work or releases
- Suggested phasing if the feature is too large for one release

## Scope Management

Scope creep happens when requirements keep getting added after approval, "small" additions accumulate, the team builds features no user asked for, or the launch date moves without explicit re-scoping.

Prevent it:
- Write explicit non-goals in every spec
- Require that any scope addition comes with a scope removal or timeline extension
- Separate "v1" from "v2" clearly in the spec
- Review the spec against the original problem statement — does everything serve it?
- Time-box investigations: "If we cannot figure out X in 2 days, we cut it"
- Create a "parking lot" for good ideas that are not in scope

## Output Format

Use markdown with clear headers. Keep the document scannable — busy stakeholders should be able to read just the headers and bold text to get the gist.

## Tips

- Be opinionated about scope. It is better to have a tight, well-defined spec than an expansive vague one.
- If the user's idea is too big for one spec, suggest breaking it into phases and spec the first phase.
- Success metrics should be specific and measurable, not vague ("improve user experience").
- Non-goals are as important as goals. They prevent scope creep during implementation.
- Open questions should be genuinely open — do not include questions you can answer from context.
